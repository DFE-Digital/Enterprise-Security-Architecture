# Enterprise Security Architecture

## Introduction

This is a repository for artefacts created by the Enterprise Security Architecture team to provide guidance and advice and ensure systems and services are developed and maintained securely and according to best practices.

### Intended Audience
Artefacts within this repository are intended for:

1. Architects starting to develop new solutions, seeking guidance and advice to ensure that these are developed in-line with the Department, Government and Industry best practives
2. Vendors and 3rd party suppliers who need to understand standard working practices and guidelines when working with the Department and its services

## Relationship of artefacts

Arteacts created by the Security Architecture team are informed and supported by existing standards and frameworks used across other Government Departments and the IT industry. We will re-use and cross-reference exisisting guidance at all times and augment with relevant content for the Department.

### Architecture artefacts

Security Architecture artefacts (Guidelines, Briefing Notes, Guidance and Patterns) are part of an overall hierarchy of artefacts used within the Department.

The relationship between the artefacts is hierarchical and cumulative, meaning that the top-level artefacts inform the next level of artefacts and so on.

The security architecture artefacts will therefore reference and leverage the higher-level standards and principles and provide the security-specific lens to ensure that delivery and support teams using these standards, principles and guidelines are creating and supporting secure services.

### Policy artefacts

The Security Architecture team work alongside the InfoSec profession to co-develop the Department's Information Security policies within the ISMS.

Policies created for the Department are informed and supported by existing standards and frameworks provided by central government and the IT industry.

The relationship is hierarchical and cumulative, meaning that the top-level policies and standards inform the Department's policies.

The Tier 1 policy is developed and maintained by InfoSec within the Department and contains the high-level details of the specific policy area.

The Tier 2 policy is developed and maintained by the Security Architecture team, and provides the next level of detail for the policy, including the specific details of how to implement the policy.
