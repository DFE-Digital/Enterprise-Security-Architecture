## Introduction and Background

Many free tools are provided as Software-as-a-service (SaaS) to help content and comms teams to review content and check for common issues.


Whilst many tools and capabilities are available and provide similar services, the Department recommends the following services.

* [Hemingway](https://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
* [Read & Write](https://www.texthelp.com/en-gb/products/read-and-write-education/)
* [Microsoft Word Grammar Editor](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/check-grammar-spelling-and-more-in-word-0f43bf32-ccde-40c5-b16a-c6a282c0d251)

*Whilst other online services are available they should not be used. Services which are not listed above may be blocked in the future.*

This guidance is provided for users of Hemingway.

## Principles for the use of Hemingway

Principles are provided to ensure that the Department's users are aware of the apropriate use for Hemingway.

### 1 - Use Hemingway for the review of appropriate content

*Only content up to **OFFICIAL** should be used with Hemingway*

#### Why?

Hemingway is provided as a free service and the Department have no control over the content once it has been uploaded for content checking. The Department have been reassured by Hemingway that content uploaded into the tool is not retained or shared, however caution must still be applied to mitigate any risks of sharing information into a free platform.

Content which is intended for publishing in the public domain (either physical media or  a website) is safe to upload into Hemingway as this is public domain content which would not create any harm or embarassment if it was accessed or used by a 3rd party via the Hemingway app.

#### How?

* Only use Hemingway to check information which is intended for the public domain

* Do not use Hemingway for any content which is classified higher than OFFICIAL

* Do not use Hemingway if you are unsure about the classification of your content. If you do not know the classification of your content you should not use Hemingway or make the content available outside the Department

### 2 - Only use the main Hemingway website

*3rd party plugins and apps may not be trusted or stable*

#### Why?

The [Hemingway website](https://hemingwayapp.com) provides a lightweight and user-friendly interface for our users to upload content and receive useful feedback directly within the web site.

3rd party browser plug-ins and standalone client apps are available but must not be used as they may require additional permissions and access to DfE devices and resources.

Utilising the web site as the sole method of using Hemingway ensures that we're aware of how our data is processed.

#### How?

* Only use the main [Hemingway website](https://hemingwayapp.com)

* Do not use Hemingway browser plugins in Chrome, Edge or any other web browser

* Be aware of the correct spelling for **Hemingway** as malicious users will set up web sites to attempt to spoof users and potentially deliver malicious content to our users

* If you notice anything suspicious whilst using Hemingway, or if you're redirected to another site, please ensure that this is logged as a security incident following standard processes

### 3 - Be aware of the support provided for Hemingway

*Hemingway is provded as-is, with no additional support*

#### Why?

Hemingway is provided as a SaaS platform and is intended for general use rather than being specifically for the Department's use or tailored to our specific needs.

There are no Service Level Agreements (SLA) from Hemingway, and our operational teams are not able to provide any support other than ensuring that the site can be accessed by the Department's users.

Any outage from Hemingway or issues with the Hemingway service will be outside of the control of our internal support teams.

#### How?

* Be aware that support responsibilities from the Department end at the connectivity to the Internet and the Hemingway website

* Do not log internal support calls for any issues with Hemingway

* Utilise one of the other available tools for grammar and content checking listed above in the event of Hemingway being unavailable 

## Risks and mitigations
