## Control 17.1

| Asset Type | Security Function | Title| 
---| ---| ---|
|N/A |Respond |Designate Personnel to Manage Incident Handling|

### The Control

Designate one key person, and at least one backup, who will manage the enterpriseâ€™s incident handling process. Management personnel are responsible for the coordination and documentation of incident response and recovery efforts and can consist of employees internal to the enterprise, third-party vendors, or a hybrid approach. If using a third-party vendor, designate at least one person internal to the enterprise to oversee any third-party work. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

### Why it is required

* Ensures that the enterprise has a single point of contact for incident handling
* Ensures a clear chain of command
* Ensures that everyone knows their role and responsibilities in the event of an incident
* By reviewing this control regularly, the enterprise can ensure that the incident handling process is kept up to date and is fit for purpose
