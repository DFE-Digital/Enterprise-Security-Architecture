---| ---| ---|
|Applications |Protect |Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process|

### The Control

Establish and maintain a secure configuration process for enterprise assets (end-user devices, including portable and mobile, non-computing/IoT devices, and servers) and software (operating systems and applications). Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

|Users |Protect |Configure Automatic Session Locking on Enterprise Assets|

### The Control

Configure automatic session locking on enterprise assets after a defined period of inactivity. For general purpose operating systems, the period must not exceed 15 minutes. For mobile end-user devices, the period must not exceed 2 minutes.

## Control 4.6

| Asset Type | Security Function | Title| 
---| ---| ---|
|Network |Protect |Securely Manage Enterprise Assets and Software|

### The Control

Securely manage enterprise assets and software. Example implementations include managing configuration through version-controlled-infrastructure-as-code and accessing administrative interfaces over secure network protocols, such as Secure Shell (SSH) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Do not use insecure management protocols, such as Telnet (Teletype Network) and HTTP, unless operationally essential.
