## Introduction

The Department's assurance processes are directly aligned with GovAssure processes and the Cyber Assurance Framework (CAF). The CAF is aligned with and are a subset of the Centre for Internet Security (CIS) v8 controls. The controls are organised into three Implementation Groups (IG) which are expanded upon in the [implementation Group overview](../Assurance/ASU-SEC002-Implementation-Groups.md)

We will focus on Implementation Group 1 (IG1) for the first iteration of the assurance processes.

> These assurance processes are mandatory for all services purchased, developed and utilised within the Department.
