The CAF is aligned with and are a subset of the Centre for Internet Security (CIS) v8 controls. The controls are organised into three Implementation Groups (IG) which are:

## Implementation Group 1

This group is the introduction baseline for the CIS Controls and consists of a foundational set of 56 cyber defense Safeguards. The Safeguards included in IG1 are what every enterprise should apply to defend against the most common attacks.

CIS describe an IG1 enterprise as a small to medium-sized with limited IT and cybersecurity expertise to dedicate towards protecting IT assets and personnel. A common concern of these enterprises is to keep the business operational, as they have a limited tolerance for downtime.

The sensitivity of the data being protected is low and principally surrounds employee and financial information. Safeguards selected for IG1 should be implementable with limited cybersecurity expertise and aimed to thwart general, non-targeted attacks. These Safeguards will also typically be designed to work in conjunction with small or home office commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software.

## Implementation Group 2

This group is comprised 74 additional Safeguards and builds upon the 56 Safeguards identified in IG1.

The 74 Safeguards selected for IG2 are intended to help security teams cope with increased operational complexity. Some Safeguards will depend on enterprise-grade technology and specialized expertise to properly install and configure.

An IG2 enterprise employs individuals who are responsible for managing and protecting IT infrastructure. These enterprises typically support multiple departments with differing risk profiles based on job function and mission.

Small enterprise units may have regulatory compliance burdens. IG2 enterprises often store and process sensitive client or enterprise information and can withstand short interruptions of service. A major concern is loss of public confidence if a breach occurs.

## Implemenation Group 3

This group is comprised of an additional 23 Safeguards and builds upon the Safeguards identified in IG1 (56) and IG2 (74) totaling the 153 Safeguards in CIS Controls v8.

An IG3 enterprise employs security experts that specialize in the different facets of cybersecurity (e.g., risk management, penetration testing, application security).

IG3 assets and data contain sensitive information or functions that are subject to regulatory and compliance oversight.

An IG3 enterprise must address availability of services and the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. Successful attacks can cause significant harm to the public welfare.

Safeguards selected for IG3 must abate targeted attacks from a sophisticated adversary and reduce the impact of zero-day attacks.
