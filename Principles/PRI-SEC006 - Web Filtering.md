## Baseline guidelines for Web Filtering and Internet access

The following guidelines are provided to guide Department operational teams when creating and maintaining groups and access to Internet sites, and managing requests for access from the Department's delivery and operational teams.

**Exceptions** to the guidelines will be reviewed with the security and architecture governance teams and approved or declined as relevant, with all decisions tracked with rationale for future reference.

**Updates or modifications** to the principles can be requested via the owning architect, and will be reviewed against the roadmap and strategy and within the Architecture profession.

**Escalations** will be dealt with within the immediate leadership within the relevant architecture domain (up to DD level) and to the SLT by exception.

## Introduction

The guidelines are provided for baseline guidance for the definition of standard and exceptional access for Internet sites and services from the Departments users, devices and services.

## Web filtering

- Everyone gets Business and News

- Social for those who require it (pending a review of allowed services)

- Developer for those who require it (pending a review of allowed services)

- sites enabled with clear business need only
- be clear that all access is monitored, including SSL (if privacy is important, don't use your work PC)
- Should apply to all, including BYO (if they want to access DfE's services in future, we\'ll block traffic to only allow from proxy endpoints)

Process to manage will be

1.  ServiceNow request to log

2.  If it\'s a specific group approval should be straightforward if
    their job matches the request

3.  If it\'s a business need for specific site(s) will need to be
    reviewed by ???

    Any shift-left should be with a well-designed service and clear
    guidelines, can\'t just transfer a poor process over with lots of
    steps/work
