# Guidelines for working remotely

## Guidelines to support users working remotely
The following guidelines are provided to guide Department users when working remotely and using public or home wireless connections to access services and resources provided by the Department.

**Exceptions** to the principles will be reviewed with the security and architecture governance teams and approved or declined as relevant, with all decisions tracked with rationale for future reference.

**Updates or modifications** to the principles can be requested via the owning architect, and will be reviewed against the roadmap and strategy and within the Architecture profession.

**Escalations** will be dealt with within the immediate leadership within the relevant architecture domain (up to DD level) and to the SLT by exception.

## Introduction
The Department's workforce are provided with laptop and tablet devices to enable flexible working to suit their personal and team's requirements. This flexibility was essential during the pandemic with regular requirements to work from home at short notice, and the need continues as our users adopt hybrid working patterns as part of our return to the office.

Our teams are diverse in nature and often geographically spread, requiring some to regularly travel to other offices for collaborative sessions or team working. The Department's remote access solution permits secure access whilst users are travelling to/from sites, and users will work flexibly whilst travelling to/from the site and whilst at the site.

These guidelines will help users to understand how to work securely and safely and protect access to the Department's systems and data.

## 1. Follow best practices to secure IT services at home

*Devices in your home can be vulnerable to malicious activity which could spread to other devices*

#### Why?
Good cyber security begins at home. Security best practices should cover all of your devices at home, not just your work-issued computer and phone. Cyber criminals may seek to exploit your personal devices to steal your credentials or personal information about you, so they can impersonate you or access your personal systems for malicious use. This could lead to a compromise which could also affect your work devices and expose your credentials or the Department's data.

#### How?
Follow standard guidance issued by the National Cyber Security Centre to help to understand risks and how to secure your services from cyber criminals. https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/advice

## 2. Protect access to home wifi services

*Following best practices to ensure that access to your home wireless network is protected*

#### Why?
Home WiFi solutions broadcast their signal beyond the boundary of your property and your service be snooped and re-used by others if not protected appropriately. This could lead to devices on your home network being accessed unintentionally and targeted for malicious activities.

#### How?
- Follow the standard best practices provided by the supplier of your broadband service
- Use a strong password for your WiFi connection, do not use obvious or easily-guessable passwords
- Ensure that encryption is enabled for wireless on your broadband router (WPA2 is the most common and is normally enabled by default)

## 3. Be aware of surroundings when working remotely

*Working in public locations may inadvertently result in people gaining access to information*

### Why?
Working remotely in public places may inadvertently allow others to overhear private conversations or the Department's data, or even credentials to our services. *Shoulder-surfing* is a technique used by criminals to view private materials and credentials from users by sitting or standing close and watching their keystrokes or viewing their screens. This could be an opportunistic activity where someone overhears something of interest, or sees content when sitting next to someone on public transport, or where a cyber criminal identifies a user with a common working pattern and uses this to monitor activities and gain valuable information.

### How?
- Be conscious when working in public places and do not discuss confidential or sensitive matters if they may be overheard
- When entering passwords and PINs be aware of who is around you and whether your keystrokes could be viewed and re-used
- Do not work on sensitive or private content when working on public transport. If on a crowded train do not use your laptop or phone if it could easily be overlooked
- Do not identify yourself as a Department worker by wearing lanyard or security ID outside of the office, this may identify you as a target by criminals

## 4. Access services securely

**

### Why?

### How?
- Use the Department's provided remote access solution at all times when working remotely to ensure that access is encrypted and secured. This provides an additional layer of protection when accessing services as services are encrypted and protected, and all access is routed via the Department's network.
- Ensure that any access to online service is using HTTPS (shown as a padlock to the left of the website in your web browser). This will ensure that data is encrypted and secured between your device and the web service
- Do not enter passwords on any sites or services which only use HTTP (shown as a website with a line crossed through in your web browser), as this data will be sent in plain-text and could be intercepted
- Ensure that any 'landing pages' which require you to accept conditions or enter payment details are used within the 'captive portal' within the Department's Remote Access solution

## 5. Use Public WiFi services carefully

*Public WiFi can be used by criminals maliciously to gain access to your systems and data if not secured appropriately*

### Why?
Public wifi is provided by in public places such as cafes and restaurants, and also on public transport, and is a convenient and cost-effective way of gaining access to Department's services and data whilst working remotely. However, data travelling across the public wifi can be subject to monitoring and snooping if not secured appropriately, and can be used to monitor and gain access to credentials which could then allow criminals to access the Department's systems and data.

### How?
- Do not save the names of public WiFi services or allow your device to 'connect automatically' as this could lead to your device connecting to a malicious wifi network whch is impersonating a public wifi service
- Ensure that any 'landing pages' which require you to accept conditions or enter payment details are used within the 'captive portal' within the Department's Remote Access solution

## 6. Apply caution when using personal devices
*Public WiFi can be used by criminals maliciously to gain access to your systems and data if not secured appropriately*

### Why?

### How?
- If accessing public WiFi via a personal device to access the Department's systems and data
