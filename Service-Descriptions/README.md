# Service Descriptions

The Cyber and Information Security Division (C&IS) offer a number of services to the Department to grant and manage access to services, integrate into standard platforms and provide operational services to teams. Service Descriptions are used to describe the services we offer within the Division and how teams engage with them.

The use of Service Descriptions ensures that teams have a clear understanding of the services offered, how to engage and the expectations on both sides for successful delivery of the service.

Each service description covers

1. A description of the service
2. Scope of the service offering
3. How to request the service
4. The information required by the C&IS team to successfully deliver the service
5. What expertise will be required by the requesting team
6. The outcome from the service request
