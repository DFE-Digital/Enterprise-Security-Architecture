## Guidance for using Hemingway

[Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/) is a writing and editing tool designed to help improve the quality of your writing.

* You should only use the browser-based version of Hemingway. You should not download the paid-for app as it may require additional permissions and access to DfE devices.

* You should only use Hemingway for content that is intended for the public domain. Do not use the Hemingway on content that is marked as **OFFICIAL SENSITIVE, SECRET OR TOP SECRET**. 

[DfE Guidance for Security classifications and document handling](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/security-handling-information.aspx#security-classifications)

* Do not use Hemingway if you are unsure about the classification of your content.

The department has no control over content once it has been added to the browser. The department has been reassured by Hemingway that content pasted into the tool is not retained or shared. However, caution must still be applied when sharing information with a third party platform.

## Support using Hemingway

Hemingway is intended for general use rather than being tailored to the departmentâ€™s specific needs.

Our IT teams are not able to provide any support with Hemingway as it is not a departmental tool. Please do not log any support calls or tickets on the [Service Portal](https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal). 

If Hemingway is unavailable, please use one of the other approved tools below:

* [Read and Write](https://www.texthelp.com/en-gb/products/read-and-write-education/).
