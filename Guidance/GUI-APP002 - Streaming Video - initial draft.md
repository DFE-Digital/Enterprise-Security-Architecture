## Guidance for Streaming Video to External Broadcast/Distribution Channels
Microsoft Teams provides the ability to stream meetings to external audiences using 3rd party websites such as Youtube and LinkedIn.

The user who wants to stream to an external audience needs to be added to the correct meeting policy within the Microsoft Teams Admin Centre.

* You should only stream content that is intended for the public domain. Do not stream content that is marked as **OFFICIAL SENSITIVE, SECRET** or **TOP SECRET**.  Do not use video streaming if you are unsure about the classification of your content.

* You should check the Terms and Conditions of the 3rd party service you are using to ensure it is suitable for the content.

## Support
To be added to the policy to enable streaming from Teams please use "Any Other Request" or an "IT Request" via the [Service Portal](https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal) . 

Our IT teams are not able to provide support with streaming as the third party streaming services are unlikely to be departmental tools.
