## Guidance for Streaming Video to External Broadcast/Distribution Channels
Microsoft Teams provides the ability to stream meetings to external audiences using 3rd party websites such as Youtube and LinkedIn.

The user who wants to stream to an external audience needs to be added to the correct user group in Active Directory to enable this functionality.

* You should only use Hemingway for content that is intended for the public domain. Do not use the Hemingway on content that is marked as **OFFICIAL SENSITIVE, SECRET** or **TOP SECRET**.  Do not use Hemingway if you are unsure about the classification of your content.

* Do not stream content for external broadcast if you are unsure about the classification of your content.

* You should check the Terms and Conditions of the 3rd party service you are using to ensure it is suitable for the content.

## Support
To be added to the group to enable streaming please request this via the [Service Portal](https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal). 

Our IT teams are not able to provide support with streaming as the third party streaming services are unlikely to be departmental tools.
